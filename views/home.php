    <h1>What is pest.plus?</h1>
    <p>Pest+ is a mostly a personal service I work on. My goal is to make it a full-fledged forum and community website, back-end coded purely in pure PHP (no frameworks) and MariaDB. Front-end is coded in pure, plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Why did I make it *pest*.plus? Well, I wanted a domain with a name that sounds basically the same in most languages. I put a high priority on my native language, Swedish, and English, and I found pest. The .plus is just the best extension I could find that would also be pronounced the same in my most important languages.</p>
    <h3>What can *I*, use it for?</h3>
    <p>Well, you can use the forum and chat when I am done developing them. If I trust you you may even get access to the file sharing system.</p>
